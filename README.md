# EMPCA
EMPCA is a Julia rewrite of [empca](https://github.com/sbailey/empca) which provides Weighted Expectation Maximization PCA, an iterative method for solving PCA while properly weighting data.

The paper S. Bailey 2012, PASP, 124, 1015 describes the underlying math
and is available as a pre-print at:
